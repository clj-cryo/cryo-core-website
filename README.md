# The Data Problem You Knew Was Coming
### Shortcuts and Technical Debt
Most greenfield projects never start out with the intent to include bad design. Experienced engineers have already spent way too much time dealing with the problems left behind by others. This time, it's going to be different! 
Often, however, what starts out as a small microservice working with occasional updates, quickly morphs into a data ingesting monster in a matter of months. No one wants to create the monster.
But time pressure is a huge part of business. Sometimes the deadline just can't be moved. When that happens, the engineer is forced to make compromises. If there were more time, maybe there could have been some research spikes done to figure out the best database to use. Data streaming is clearly becoming a standard but it can take time to build the right design from the ground up to support it. But shortcuts had to be taken, and maybe some tests had to be skipped. 
All of this adds up to technical debt. Tech debt is just like credit, buy now, pay later. Sometimes it can be ignored, but eventually, it starts to slow the development process down. Bugs start to take over the whole release cycle.Before you know it, there's almost no time for new features. In an article written by [https://www.sonarsource.com/blog/new-research-from-sonar-on-cost-of-technical-debt/|Sonar], a study made on 200 different projects revealed the annual cost for a project with one million lines of code (LoC) is $306,000. That is the equivalent of 5,500 hours of engineering time.

## Who is Cryo For?
In the end, software is really about helping people solve real-world problems. Cryo is a Clojure library so right out of the gate, you know you're dealing with what could be the most productive language on the planet. Clojure is functional, flexible, and fast and fits most software needs like a glove. 

The development team behind Cryo has been developing in Clojure for almost a decade and wants to share the love. That's why the heart of Cryo will always remain open source. We want the Clojure community to expand. Others need to see what they've been missing! 
Cryo is an approachable library that encourages good design and lets you, the architect, keep your options open so that you can have the flexibility you need to grow your tech stack without the library getting in the way.

## Who is Cryo For?
In the end, software is really about helping people solve real-world problems. Cryo is a Clojure library so right out of the gate, you know you're dealing with what could be the most productive language on the planet. Clojure is functional, flexible, and fast and fits most software needs like a glove. 

The development team behind Cryo has been developing in Clojure for almost a decade and wants to share the love. That's why the heart of Cryo will always remain open source. We want the Clojure community to expand. Others need to see what they've been missing! 
Cryo is an approachable library that encourages good design and lets you, the architect, keep your options open so that you can have the flexibility you need to grow your tech stack without the library getting in the way.
